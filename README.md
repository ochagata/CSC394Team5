In order to run the server and view the website, all you need to do is either download a zip or clone the project,
go to the Pazzos folder and typing in "python manage.py runserver" in the terminal.
By default this will create it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to check out the admin log in page as well as the admin view.
The email is team5@team5.com and the password is "team5"

If you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ARK, you will see a basic hello world page.
If you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile, you will see a very basic profile editing page.
It supports changing everything but the user's password at the moment. Both of these pages require an account,
so attempting to visit them for the first time will allow you to see the login/registration page that is currently set up.
